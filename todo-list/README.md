# Simple JS To-Do App

A basic, interactive To-Do List application built with JavaScript and HTML. This project manages tasks through browser prompts and logs results directly to the developer console.

* **Add Tasks**: Store new items in a list.
* **List Tasks**: View all items with their specific index numbers.
* **Delete Tasks**: Remove items by entering their index.
* **Quit**: Safely exit the application.

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Open the **Console** (Right-click > Inspect > Console).
3. Use the following commands in the pop-up prompt:
   - `add`: To add a task.
   - `list`: To see all tasks in the console.
   - `delete`: To remove a task by number.
   - `quit`: To stop the app.

## 🧠 Logic Used
